# Zillow-Zestimate
 
Zillow has a Zestimate feature which predicts the sale price of a house listed on their website. Zillow has incurred losses due to the inaccurate predictions of the zestimate feature.

This project makes an attempt at predicting the log error in the zestimate value. Without having the knowledge of the actual model for Zestimate calulation, we try to analyse what features (parameters) cause the Zestimate to be off and thus inaccurate.

The data is made available by Zillow via a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1/overview)
